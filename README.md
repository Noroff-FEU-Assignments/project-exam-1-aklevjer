A photography blog that includes gear reviews, guides, locations, and tips.

## Description

This project was my Project Exam 1 at Noroff. The task was to create a blog site with the design and topics of our own choosing, by using the knowledge gained from the first year at Noroff. This involved using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with WordPress serving as a headless CMS.

Some of the requirements include a carousel on the homepage, modal functionality for images on the Blog Post Specific page, a 'Load More' button, as well as JavaScript validation for the contact form.

**The site contains the following pages:**

- Home
- Blog
- Blog Post Specific
- About
- Contact
